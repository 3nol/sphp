# This MATLAB code implements the SPHP image stitching method

This warp was proposed in the SPHP paper from Chang et al. [1] in 2014.

### Running examples

Run a "run_*_example.m" in MATLAB to reproduce the results shown in the paper and in the supplementary materials.
The implementation in this fork was modified to split up functionality.
Please email the original author (frank@cmlab.csie.ntu.edu.tw) if you have any problems/questions about the code, *not including the changes here*.
